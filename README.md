## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading**

   * Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Handled missing values and duplicates
   * Standardized data types and formats
   * Removed inconsistencies and outliers (where applicable)

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Analyzed data distributions and trends
   * Identified key patterns and correlations
   * Generated visualizations for better understanding

4. **SQL Analysis**

   * Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL
   * Wrote SQL queries to answer business questions
   * Performed aggregations, filtering, and joins

5. **Dashboard Development**

   * Built an interactive **Power BI dashboard**
   * Included KPIs, filters, and visual summaries

6. **Reporting & Presentation**

   * Created a detailed analytical report
   * Designed a professional PPT to summarize insights
